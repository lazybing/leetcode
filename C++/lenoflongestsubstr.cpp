/*
 * Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters
 *
 * Examples:
 * Input        Output       Explanation
 * "abcabcbb"     3          substr:"abc", len is 3
 * "bbbbb"        1          substr:"b", len is 1
 * "pwwkew"       3          substr:"wke", len is 3
 *
 * Test Case && Boundary Test:
 * 1. Test If the input string is empty.
 * 2. Some special cases: all characters in the string is unique/same
 *
 * Think more:
 * 1. how the sliding window algorithm used in this problem
 * 2. what are the time&space complexity in each solutions
